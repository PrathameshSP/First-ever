        Now is the winter of our discontent
        Made glorious summer by this sun of York;
        And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house
        In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
        Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;
        Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;
        Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,
        Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.
        Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;
        And now, instead of mounting barded steeds
        To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,
        He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber
        To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.
        But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,
        Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;
        I, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty
        To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;
        I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,
