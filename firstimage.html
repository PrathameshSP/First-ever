        <h2>RCB</h2>
        <p>The Royal Challengers Bangalore (often abbreviated as RCB) are a franchise cricket team based in Bangalore,
            Karnataka, that plays in the Indian Premier League (IPL). It was founded in 2008 by United Spirits and named
            after the company's liquor brand Royal Challenge. Since its inception, the team has played its home matches
            at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium.[2]

            The Royal Challengers have never won the IPL but finished runners-up on three occasions between 2009 and
            2016. Their lack of success over the years despite the presence of various notable players has earned them
            the tag of "underachievers".[3][4] The team holds the records of both the highest and the lowest totals in
            the IPL â€“ 263/5 and 49 respectively</p><br>
        <h3>Random</h3>
        <p>Where does it come from?
            Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical
            Latin
            literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at
            Hampden-Sydney
            College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage,
            and
            going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum
            comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil)
            by
            Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the
            Renaissance.
            The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

            The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections
            1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact
            original
            form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.</p><br>
